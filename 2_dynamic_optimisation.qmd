## Why are we even discussing Dynamic Optimization (DO)?

- We've talked about the price path of NRR.
- We've also see that as $t \to \infty, \ p_t \not \to \infty$ because of the availability of backstop.
- However, until such a backstop becomes available, we need to determine the **optimal time path of the price** of the existing NRR.
- This is done by optimising the resource use along the time $t \to T$.
- For  this we need **dynamic optimisation**, for static optimisation does not work here.

## Difference between DO and SO.

- Static Optimisation

\begin{align}
\text{max }u &= u(X,Y)\\
\text{s.t. } P_x.X + P_y.Y &= I\\
\text{where; }X \ \text{and}\ Y&: \text{are goods}\\
I &: \text{income}\\
X^* \ , \ Y^*&: \text{Solution to the optimization problem} \\
&\quad\text{at a specific time period}
\end{align}

- Dynamic Optimisation
  - Objective is to maximise lifetime utility by optimising our consumption of $X$ and $Y$ at each time period.
  - E.g. over our lifetime we can decide on how much to consume, save, invest, etc. to optimise our life.

- E.g. the Indian economy is deciding on optimum investment in each period for 5 years so that at the end of the $5^th$ year, the objective of accumulating a certain level of capital stock is realised. The cost should be minimum.
