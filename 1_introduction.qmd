## Justification for studying REE.

- Economics is about allocating resources efficiently.
- To our understanding "environment" is also a scarce resource.

## Definition of natural resource
- Naturally occurring resources which can be made available for mankind under feasible **social**, **economic**, and **technological** framework.- Can we classify sea water as a natural resource?

- Two types: 
  - Renewable Resources: Generating capacity - forests, fishery, solar energy, etc.
  - Non-renewable resources: No generating capacity over an economically feasible time horizon - coal, oil, etc.
  
---

- Do renewable resources also get exhausted?
  - Yes, if the rate of extraction $>$ the rate of growth.
- Are we exhausting our nonrenewable resources too rapidly or too slowly?
  - **Optimal rate of extraction**: The rate of extraction that maximises that inter-temporal benefits derived from such non-renewable resources.

---

- Example: 1000 kg of coal to be used over 10 years.

## The optimal path

- What should be the optimal path (*if we join the points we get a path*) of extraction for a non-renewable resource (NRR)?
- For market goods

- Can we apply `p = mc` for a NRR?
  - No, NRR are not easily replicable $\rightarrow$ today's production/extraction has some opportunity cost as the *same resource is not available for tomorrow.*
  
---

- In this situation we have an additional (opportunity) cost.

$p = mc_e + mu_c$
where; 
  - $mc_e:$ marginal cost of extraction
  - $mu_c:$ marginal user cost
  
---


- Let us assume we have some amount of NRR which we are going to use in 2 periods;
  $0: 1^{st} \text{period}$
  
  $1: \text{last period}$
  
  $p_0: \text{price at } t_0$
  
  $p_1: \text{price at } t_1$
  
- The resource owner has to decide **whether to use the resource today or keep it for tomorrow**.
  
  $p_0 - mc_e$: Today's benefit
  
  $p_1 - mc_e$: Tomorrow's benefit (if the resource is left for tomorrow)
  
---

- At $t_0$, the owner has to convert tomorrow's benefit to today's benefit.
- This benefit is given by
$$
\frac{p_1 - mc_e}{1 + r}
$$

where $r$ is the rate of interest or the discount rate.

## {.incremental}

- We are converting tomorrow's benefit to today's benefit by discounting *and the discount rate is $r$*.
- If $(p_0 - mc_e) > \frac{(p_1 - mc_e)}{1 + r}$ $\implies$ the resource owner should use it today. The RHS is also called the **discounted benefit**.
- If $(p_0 - mc_e) < \frac{(p_1 - mc_e)}{1 + r}$ $\implies$ the resource owner should use it tomorrow.
- If $(p_0 - mc_e) = \frac{(p_1 - mc_e)}{1 + r}$ $\implies$ the resource owner is indifferent between today's use and tomorrow's.

---

- $(p_0 - mc_e) = \frac{(p_1 - mc_e)}{1 + r}$ is called the equilibrium condition.
- $p_0 = mc_e + \frac{(p_1 - mc_e)}{1 + r}$
- Since the marginal cost pricing is not applicable for NRR, an additional opportunity cost was added to $mc_e$.
- This component of cost is known as the marginal user cost (muc)
where $mu_c = \frac{(p_1 - mc_e)}{1 + r}$
- $mc_e + mu_c = \text{augmented marginal cost}$
- If the $mu_c$ is not added to the $mc_e$ then the NRR may not be available for extraction tomorrow.

---


\begin{align}
\because p_0 &= mc_e + \frac{(p_1 - mc_e)}{1 + r}\\
p_1 &= mc_e + (p_0 - mc_e)(1 + r) \\
p_2 &= mc_e + (p_0 - mc_e)(1 + r)^2\\
\text{In general we can write};\\
p_t &= mc_e + (p_0 - mc_e)(1 + r)^t\\
\end{align}


- This is the **price path** or a **series of optimal prices** for optimal extraction at various points in time.
- This indicates that $p_t$ is a **dynamic optimization** problem rather than a static optimization.

## {.smaller}


\begin{align}
\because p_1 &= mc_e + (p_0 - mc_e)(1 + r) \\
(1+r) &= \frac{(p_1 - mc_e)}{(p_0 - mc_e)}  \\
r &= \frac{(p_1 - mc_e)-(p_0 - mc_e)}{(p_0 - mc_e)}
\end{align}

- This $p - mc_e$ is also known as **Marginal Resource Rent**
  where; 
  
  $p_1$: price of NRR 
    
  $mc_e$: cost of extraction of one unit of NRR 
  
  $r$: growth of marginal resource rent

---

- We can now say that *along the optimum path of marginal resource extraction, the marginal resource rent should grow at the rate of discount* i.e. $r = \frac{(p_1 - mc_e)-(p_0 - mc_e)}{(p_0 - mc_e)}$.
- In other words; *the most socially and economically profitable extraction path of a NRR is one along which marginal resource rent (MRR) must grow at the rate of interest or discount*: **Hotelling's Rule (1931)**.
  
---

- Note that optimum extraction depends on two things $p_1: \text{tomorrow's price }$ and $r: \text{the discount or the interest rate}$
- $p_1$ is the expected price that the resource owner will use.
- $r$ varies from person to person.
  - Bias for today then use heavy discount rate.
  
---

- We know that at equilibrium $p_t = mc_e + (p_0 - mc_e)(1 + r)^t$.
- Now $\text{as }t \rightarrow \infty, p_t \rightarrow \infty$
- Is there any such possibility? For instance, say after 200 years or more the price of petrol becomes infinite.

---

- The answer is **No**.
1. After 200 years or more we might find a substitute or an alternative resource or technology for petrol.
  - **Backstop**: The availability of alternative (substitute) resource (technology) which makes the utilization of existing resource more efficient. E.g. solar energy.
2. The availability of a backstop will impact (reduce) the demand for petrol and hence put a cap on the upper limit of the price.

## Role of Backstop in determining the optimal price path of an existing NRR

- Let's assume $mc_b$ is the marginal cost of extraction of the backstop, and $mc_b > mc_e$
- We also assume that there is no user cost for the backstop (unlike the NRR) because we have just discovered the backstop and have it in adequate supply.

---

```{r}
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("images/fig_1.png")
```


---

- **Shift date**: the time at which the NRR gets exhausted.
- Let us denote this as $T$.
- The price path of the existing NRR at time $T$ is

$$
p_T = mc_e + (p_0 - mc_e)(1 + r)^T ... (1)
$$

---

- Since there is no user cost for backstop,

\begin{align}
p_T = mc_b \dots (2)
\end{align}

where, 

$p_T$: price of the backstop

From (1) and (2), we get

\begin{align}
\implies mc_b &= mc_e + (p_0 - mc_e)(1+r)^T\\
\implies p_0 - mc_e &= \frac{mc_b-mc_e}{(1+r)^T}\\
\implies p_0 &= mc_e + \frac{mc_b-mc_e}{(1+r)^{T-0}}
\end{align}

---

\begin{align}
\because p_0 - mc_e &= \frac{mc_b-mc_e}{(1+r)^T}\\
\implies p_0 &= mc_e + \frac{mc_b-mc_e}{(1+r)^{T-0}}\\
\quad \vdots &= \ \vdots \quad + \quad \vdots\\
\implies p_t &= mc_e + \frac{mc_b-mc_e}{(1+r)^{T-t}} \ \forall \ t<T
\end{align}

---

Insights

1. Marginal cost of extraction for the backstop $mc_b$ determines the price path of the existing resource at $t$.
2. If $mc_b$ is high i.e. the probability of harvesting a backstop is low, then $p_t$ will also be high and vice-versa.
3. $mc_b$ sets an upper limit on the price of the existing resource at time $t$.

Answers:
1. A natural resource is defined as a naturally occurring resource that can be made available for mankind under feasible social, economic, and technological frameworks. Renewable resources (like forests, fishery, solar energy) have a generating capacity, while non-renewable resources (like coal, oil) lack regenerative capacity over an economically feasible time horizon.

2. Renewable resources can become exhausted when the rate of extraction exceeds the rate of growth. For example, a forest can be depleted if trees are cut down faster than they can regrow, leading to permanent ecosystem damage and resource depletion.

3. Hotelling's Rule (1931) states that the most socially and economically profitable extraction path of a non-renewable resource is one where the marginal resource rent grows at the rate of interest or discount rate. This principle helps optimize the long-term economic value of finite resources.

4. Marginal user cost represents the opportunity cost of extracting a resource today, which reduces its availability for future use. This additional cost component means that for non-renewable resources, pricing is not simply marginal cost (p = mc), but includes an opportunity cost component (p = mce + muc).

5. Factors influencing coal extraction strategy include:
- Current market prices
- Expected future prices
- Extraction costs
- Discount rate
- Technological capabilities
- Environmental regulations
- Alternative energy availability

6. The discount rate determines the present value of future benefits. A higher discount rate makes immediate extraction more attractive, as future benefits are heavily discounted. Conversely, a lower discount rate might encourage resource conservation for future use.

7. A backstop is an alternative resource or technology that provides a substitute when the primary resource becomes scarce or expensive. It plays a crucial role in determining the optimal extraction path by setting an upper limit on the price of the existing resource and influencing extraction decisions.

8. The price of a non-renewable resource like petrol cannot increase indefinitely because:
- Alternatives or substitute technologies will emerge
- A backstop technology will reduce demand
- The market will seek more efficient or cheaper energy sources
- Technological innovations can create new extraction or replacement methods

9. Renewable resources require sustainable management to maintain regenerative capacity, while non-renewable resources demand strategic extraction to maximize long-term economic value. Renewable resources focus on growth rates, while non-renewable resources concentrate on optimal depletion strategies.

10. Technological innovations can impact resource extraction strategies by:
- Reducing extraction costs
- Improving efficiency of resource use
- Creating alternative technologies
- Enabling extraction of previously inaccessible resources
- Developing more sustainable extraction methods
